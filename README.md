Online meetings often lack effective question-andanswer dynamics, hampering professional engagement.
This project introduces an interactive conversational agent, using Large Language Models, to enhance realtime questioning and foster a more interactive and productive virtual meeting environment for working professionals. The goal is to streamline information
retrieval and elevate the quality of online professional interactions.
